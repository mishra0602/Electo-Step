**It is my Diploma Major project **

**# Electo-Step**
Electro-Step is a motion-based electricity generator designed to convert mechanical energy from walking or running into electrical energy. Using piezoelectric crystals, the system generates and stores power for practical applications, such as charging small electronic devices. This project provides an innovative, eco-friendly, and portable solution for energy generation in remote and outdoor environments.

**Features**
Converts walking or running into electrical energy.
Stores energy in a rechargeable lithium-ion battery.
Compact, portable, and low-cost design.
Eco-friendly and self-sustaining system.
Ideal for outdoor use and remote areas.

**Components**
Piezoelectric Crystals: Key components for generating electricity from mechanical stress.
Rectifier Circuit: Converts AC generated by the piezoelectric crystals to DC.
Filter Circuit: Smoothens the DC signal for stable storage.
Charging Module (TP4056): Charges a lithium-ion battery and manages its operation.
Lithium-Ion Battery: Stores the generated electricity for future use.
Frame: Supports the piezoelectric crystals and enhances energy generation through optimized design.
System Design

**The system consists of:**
Generator Pad: Contains piezoelectric crystals sandwiched between two parallel plates with a rubber layer for pressure distribution.
Charging Bank: Includes the rectifier, filter, and TP4056 charging module for energy regulation and storage.

**Working Principle**
Electro-Step operates on the piezoelectric effect, where mechanical stress applied to piezoelectric crystals generates an electrical charge.
When the user walks or runs on the generator pad, pressure is applied to the piezoelectric crystals.
This mechanical pressure generates an AC voltage, which is rectified and filtered to produce DC power.
The TP4056 module regulates and stores the generated energy in a lithium-ion battery.
The stored energy can then be used to charge small electronic devices, such as mobile phones.
